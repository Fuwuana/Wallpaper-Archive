#  Tryptex/Gamegenorator/Pierce's Desktop Wallpapers

This repo isn't all that special, it's primary purpose is to simply be a library of desktop wallpapers that I encounter and take a liking to. Feel free to clone this and use it as a starting place for your own digital archive for Wallpapers (Assuming you don't have one already).

This project is inspired by DistroTubes vast collection of wallpapers over at https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers
